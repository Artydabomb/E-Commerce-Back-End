# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This project allows a user to modify ("CRUD") backend data by establishing written routes to modify the mentioned data. An environment that loosely simulates an e-commerce database, this project allows a user to add to, remove from or modify pre-existing items.

## Installation
The following NPM dependences are required to be installed for the use of this program: 

Express, Sequelize, Mysql12, Dotenv 

## Usage
Initialize the program by going to the root file and typing "npm run start" into the terminal to initialize the server. Next, to seed the pre-existing data, ensure that the MySql database is running in the background, then typing "npm run seed" into the terminal. Since this is a backend application, Insomnia or Postman have to be used to establish communication to the backend to modify the e-commerce data through CRUD operations.
